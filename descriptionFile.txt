Problem statement

“Build a website and deploy it on GitHub”

Many people find it challenging to keep track of their tasks effectively. 
Existing to-do list tools often lack user-friendly interfaces and comprehensive features, making task management cumbersome. 
Users need a simple yet powerful online platform that helps them create, organize, and prioritize tasks effortlessly. 
Additionally, the lack of collaboration features in many tools makes it difficult for teams to work together efficiently on shared tasks. 
Thus, there is a need for a straightforward to-do list website that simplifies task management for individuals and enables seamless collaboration for teams.
