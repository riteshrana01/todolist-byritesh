 HTML Elements and Their Uses

 `<!DOCTYPE html>` Tag
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag is a declaration used in HTML to specify the document type and version of HTML being utilized. This tag must be placed at the very beginning of the HTML document, preceding the `<html>` tag. It informs the browser about the HTML version in use, enabling the correct rendering of the webpage.
