The <!DOCTYPE html> tag is a declaration used in HTML to specify the document type and version of HTML being used. It must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. The declaration helps the browser to render the web page correctly.

The <html lang="en"> tag is the root element of an HTML document. It encloses all other elements in the document and specifies the language of the document's content. This information is used by browsers and assistive technologies to improve accessibility and user experience.

The <head> tag in HTML is a crucial element that contains meta-information about the document. This tag can include the title, character set, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other meta tags that provide information about the HTML document.

The <link> tag in HTML is used to define the relationship between the current document and an external resource. It is most commonly used to link to external stylesheets, but it can also be used for other types of resources like icons, prefetching, and web fonts.
The <body> tag in HTML represents the content of an HTML document. It contains all the visible content that users see when they visit a webpage.
The <div> tag in HTML is a versatile container element used to group together other HTML elements and apply styling or JavaScript functionality to them collectively. It stands for "division" and is often used to create sections or divisions within a webpage.
The <input> tag in HTML is used to create interactive controls for web forms. It allows users to enter data that can be submitted to a server for processing. The type of input control is defined by the type attribute.
The <ul> and <li> tags in HTML are used together to create unordered lists. The <ul> tag defines an unordered list, while the <li> tag defines each list item within that list.
The <h> tag, commonly known as the heading tag, is used in HTML to define headings or titles within a document. Headings are essential for structuring the content of a webpage and improving its accessibility and readability. HTML provides six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the most important (typically used for the main title of the page) and <h6> being the least important (usually used for subheadings or minor titles).
The <script> tag in HTML is used to define client-side JavaScript code or to reference an external JavaScript file. It allows developers to add interactivity, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and perform various other tasks on the client side.
