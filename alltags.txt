The <!DOCTYPE html> tag is a declaration used in HTML to specify the document type and version of HTML being used. It must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. The declaration helps the browser to render the web page correctly.
The <html lang="en"> tag is the root element of an HTML document. It encloses all other elements in the document and specifies the language of the document's content. This information is used by browsers and assistive technologies to improve accessibility and user experience.

The <link> tag in HTML is used to define the relationship between the current document and an external resource. It is most commonly used to link to external stylesheets, but it can also be used for other types of resources like icons, prefetching, and web fonts.
The <body> tag in HTML represents the content of an HTML document. It contains all the visible content that users see when they visit a webpage.
The <div> tag in HTML is a versatile container element used to group together other HTML elements and apply styling or JavaScript functionality to them collectively. It stands for "division" and is often used to create sections or divisions within a webpage.
